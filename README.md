# Primes (Numbers with k prime factors) in a range
Examples:

Input : A = 4, B = 10, K = 2.

Output : 6 10

Given range is [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

From the above range 6 and 10 have 2 distinct 
prime factors, 6 = 3*2; 10 = 5*2.

Input : A = 14, B = 18, K = 2.

Output : 14 15 18

Range = [14, 15].

Both 14, 15 and 18 have 2 distinct prime factors,
14 = 7*2, 15 = 3*5 and 18 = 2*3*3
